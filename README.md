# clone-spotify

hello, this is a simple application where I took my first steps in tailwind,
and when we learn something new, nothing better than practicing, right?
so I decided to make a clone of the spotify site with react and tailwind,
but as I said before the focus here is tailwind, so as you can see the site is
fully responsive and let's say 90% faithful to the original site.
